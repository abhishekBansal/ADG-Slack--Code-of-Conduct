ADG Slack aims to be an inclusive space that is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

For this to be the case, it is vital that we all follow a basic set of guidelines and most importantly adhere to the code of conduct. As such, please make sure you read this Code of Conduct and Basic Usage Guidelines in its entirety. This isn’t your regular License Agreement that you should scroll through and agree blindy. It’s here for a reason and also contains practical information. 

## How to behave

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration, respect and empathy in your speech and actions. Remember, we have all been through different stages of learning when adopting technologies. 
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Disagreements on things are fine, argumentative behaviour or trolling are not. 

## How not to behave

* Do *not* perform threats of violence or use violent language directed against another person.
* Do *not* make jokes of sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory nature, or use language of this nature.
* Do *not* post or display sexually explicit or violent material.
* Do *not* post or threaten to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Do *not* make personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Do *not* engage in sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes and sexual advances.
* Do *not* advocate for, or encourage, any of the above behavior.

## How to report issues

If someone is acting inappropriately or violating this Code of Conduct in any shape or form, and they are not receptive to your feedback or you prefer not to confront them, please get in touch with one of the Administrators. The main Administrators are Ilya Ryzhenkov (@orangy), Hadi Hariri (@hhariri) and Roman Belov (@roman.belov). 

## Basic Usage Guidelines
The influx of messages per day and the numerous channels can lead to a lot of noise and little value in the long run in Slack tema. If we all follow a set of guidelines, it can help make things more useful and bearable for everyone. 

* Please remember this is a Slack team for Android. If you have generic questions that are about a technology (which may or may not be used with Android), maybe it’s better to use another forum, such as StackOverflow. 
* Find the right channel to ask your question. 
* New channels should be focused around a well-known technology or area of interest. Create them sparingly. And before creating a new channel, make sure it doesn’t exist in any other shape or form. If you do end up creating a channel, make sure you set the topic. 
* When you ask a question, please be patient. Don’t repeat it. Or at least not immediately.
* Please do not ping or mention someone directly to get your questions answered
* Don’t split messages into multiple ones. Ask it all in a single message.
* Use code blocks. Don’t paste code as plain text. Slack supports Kotlin/Java markup. If the code you are pasting is longer than a few lines, use "Code or text snippet" available from + menu next to message input. Only first few lines will be displayed to all users and people interested in the code can expand your code to look into details.
* While it’s polite to say “Hi” or “I have a question” before asking something, it doesn’t scale and leads to noise. You can say hello in the same message you ask the question if you like.
* Using threads is not required, but do take into account that it does allow people to more easily follow conversations, especially those jumping in late.
* Use reactions to show gratitude as opposed to a message. It reduces the noise and gets the message across.
* Don’t use reactions to tell people they’re in the wrong place or asking the wrong question. If they’re on the wrong channel, point them to the right one. If their question is badly worded, help them correct it. Have empathy. 
* Take into account cultural differences. As they say, what the British say isn’t what the British mean. Remember this both as the receiver and producer of messages.  
* Don’t create integrations with Slack. Given this is running on the free tier, the number is limited and thus it won’t be approved.
* @channel, @here and other forms of notifications are disabled, even if you own a channel (unfortunately Slack doesn’t allow fine-grained permissions).
* Use the #meta channel if you’re unsure about how to do something.  

## Common Channels
